# Evaluating the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Project and Its Role in Redefining Energy Dependency in Africa


# Project Overview

This project explores how the Nigeria–Morocco Gas Pipeline, spanning 13 countries and stretching over 5,660 kilometers, could reshape the energy landscape of West and North Africa. With a projected supply of 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas annually, the pipeline has the potential to expand access to cleaner energy, foster regional cooperation, and boost trade.

The study evaluates energy dependency profiles across the pipeline route and assesses whether the project advances Pan-African energy integration or reinforces extractive, export-first models. It draws on multi-country data related to gas demand, infrastructure readiness, and governance capacity, and introduces a custom Energy Integration Index to support policy recommendations.

# Objectives

Analyze the gas supply-demand gap in each of the 13 pipeline countries.
Evaluate the impact potential of the pipeline on energy poverty, industrialization, and economic development.
Assess the risk of replicating extractivist models, where local access is deprioritized in favor of exports.
Recommend policies and regional frameworks that promote equitable energy sharing and sustainable development.

# Research Questions

- What is the current state of energy access and gas consumption in each country along the pipeline?
- How reliant is each country on external energy imports, and what alternatives exist?
- How does GDP per capita correlate with energy infrastructure and consumption patterns?
- Does the pipeline present a regional opportunity for energy equity, or is it primarily a strategic export route?
- What governance and policy frameworks are required to ensure inclusive energy distribution?

# Methodology
This study uses a comparative, indicator-based approach to assess the energy readiness of 13 countries along the Nigeria–Morocco Gas Pipeline route. Data were sourced from the World Bank, IEA, Transparency International, and Global Energy Monitor. Key indicators include electricity access, gas consumption and production, GDP per capita, pipeline infrastructure, and governance (CPI and regulatory presence). These will be normalized and used to construct a composite Energy Integration Index (EII), with countries grouped using basic cluster analysis to identify readiness typologies.
